  "description": "This small and awesome library was made to simplify a basic socket.io setup by using an existing express server. In this example the express server will be setup with the [express-starter](#) library. The library will scan a directory for files that include socket.io handlers to keep everything modular without pain. Files inside the scanned directory that do not have the required socket handler block will fail to load and cause an error.",
